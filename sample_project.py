"""
The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.

Sample output is shown below.
```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12

+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4

```

In the example, there is an executable named `app`. It takes as command line
arguments a comma separated list of integers, and the target integer. Your app
doesn't need to have identical input/output mechanisms. For example, you could
read from a file instead of the command line.

You can assume that all input values are integers. You can assume that there aren't
any repeat values in the list.

The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases
should be handled appropriately.

    Function that finds pairs of integers from a list that

    empty, it also returns an empty set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nums : List[int]
